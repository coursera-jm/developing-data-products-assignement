## Introduction

```{r echo = F, message = F, cache = F}
opts_chunk$set(results = 'asis', comment = NA, message = F, tidy = F)
```
We developped an app plotting some of the probability density functions available in R.

The parameters necessary for each distribution adapt to the distribution chosen. \

For example, if you want to draw a normal curve, the app asks for mean and sd. I you wnat to draw a Poisson curve, it asks for lambda.

Densities are drawn by generating observations (x) and calculating the density (d- function in R). 
Cumulative densities curves work by providing the plot with a the p- function.

## Probability Density Functions

R pseudo and parameters:

    -     binom = size, prob
    -     chisq = df, ncp
    -     f     = df1, df2, ncp
    -     norm  = mean, sd
    -     hyper = m, n, k
    -     pois  = lambda
    -     t     = df, ncp
    -     unif  = min, max

## R Base

Which one is true about the Poisson distribution?

1. Defined as the number of successes in a sequence of n independent yes/no experiments.
2. Mean and Variance define the distribution, which is symetrical around the mean.
3. Defined as as the ratio of two scaled chi-squared variates.
4. The Î» parameter is equal to the expected value of X and also to its variance.
5. Defined as the sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random variables.
